                <p id = "CodeDesc">Hi, I'm 4lex Forseti. I am an American game developer based out of Chicago, Illinois and have always loved video games. The first time
                    I ever played a video game was at the young age of 3, when parents introduced me to mobile games. As a kid, I had always wondered how I could manipulate
                    or change the interface and mechanics of the game but never really knew how. When I was 8, things started to reveal themselves a little more as I first
                    found out about programming and looked into learning it with an app called SoloLearn. However, this was not really sufficient. When I got into middle school,
                    I had my first computer that I could use for game engines and began to experiment with things like 3D modeling and programming. I soon started to try things
                    like Roblox Studio, Unreal Engine, and then finally Unity. At first, dedication to something as big as making games seemed daunting and scary. I struggled
                    at first to stick with a game engine and kept hopping around until I really decided to take the steps to learn C# with courses from Microsoft, and one winter
                    break began to develop for a week straight. Ever since then, I have been practicing C# and have been continuing to learn through my journey with making mostly
                    2D games in Unity. Now this time, I have started a project called ASTROCREE that I really hope will be of interest to you!
                    This page is dedicated to my new game in progress called ASTROCREE.
                    <br><br>
                    Here I will post recent update videos or pictures of the games progress as well as little hints of story.

                <p id = "CodeDesc">For the placement of nodes, I am using a matrix based grid system. However, first I will show how to draw this grid so 
                    we can see it visually. To begin, we start by defining how many rows and columns we would like as well as keeping a seperate
                    surface to blit onto the main window (I will talk more about this later).

                <p id = "CodeDesc">Then, I will create two arrays inserting a for loop into them to make each grid line for every row and column.

                    this new grid we've created.<br>
                    First, I will be creating a list to represent all of the rectangles we want to draw.
                    In our while loop, a function will iterate through this list, making it easy to draw and remove rectangles
                    using append and remove functions. This system also allows us to layer rectangles in the way we need to,
                    so objects do not overlap incorrectly.<br>
                    There is just one problem, however, since a list is ordered, removing an element from a list directly
                    can have a multitude of issues. When trying to use list, users will get a null exception error as a result
                    of trying to index or draw a rect of None. Consequently, I will be using dictionaries instead for easy access
                    to a spot in the dictionary to remove rects and avoid that odd null exception error.

                    First we can define a means of actually calling the add_node function so that nodes (or rects) 
                    will render where we want them to on our grid.<br>
                    Using Pygame's input system (the same system we use to detect if the window is closed), 
                    we get every time the user clicks their mouse on the screen. Like:
                </p>
                <div class = "CodeSegment">
                    <p id = "CodeSegmentText">
                        # Again inside the same loop as pygame.QUIT()<br>
                        if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:<br>
                            <div class = "indent"># Getting the position of the mouse to see what cell user clicked</div>
                            <div class = "indent">add_node(pygame.mouse.get_pos())</div>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p id = "CodeDesc">Now that our function is being called, we can begin by programming just how we determines
                    which cell the user clicked on. Recall that in the grid system we made two arrays containing x and y values
                    of where grid lines were to br drawn. Now, we are able to use those same arrays to calculate what cell is clicked.
                    The code for which is the following:
                </p>

                <p id = "CodeDesc">Hmm... 18 and 0? That doesn't seem right. First off, we have 19 columns and 11 rows supposedly,
                    but because those are grid lines being drawn in and not the number of cells, we have minus 1. Meaning, 18 and 10
                    are both the correct numbers, but our y is 0. How is that? Well, during this process I found out that Pygame's
                    y-coordinate system is in some way or another upside down.<br>
