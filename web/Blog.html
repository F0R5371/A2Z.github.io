                <!-- Description -->
                <p id = "CodeDesc">Hi, I'm 4lex Forseti. I am an American game developer based out of Chicago, Illinois and have always loved video games. The first time
                    I ever played a video game was at the young age of 3, when parents introduced me to mobile games. As a kid, I had always wondered how I could manipulate
                    or change the interface and mechanics of the game but never really knew how. When I was 8, things started to reveal themselves a little more as I first
                    found out about programming and looked into learning it with an app called SoloLearn. However, this was not really sufficient. When I got into middle school,
                    I had my first computer that I could use for game engines and began to experiment with things like 3D modeling and programming. I soon started to try things
                    like Roblox Studio, Unreal Engine, and then finally Unity. At first, dedication to something as big as making games seemed daunting and scary. I struggled
                    at first to stick with a game engine and kept hopping around until I really decided to take the steps to learn C# with courses from Microsoft, and one winter
                    break began to develop for a week straight. Ever since then, I have been practicing C# and have been continuing to learn through my journey with making mostly
                    2D games in Unity. Now this time, I have started a project called ASTROCREE that I really hope will be of interest to you!
                    This page is dedicated to my new game in progress called ASTROCREE.
                    <br><br>
                    Here I will post recent update videos or pictures of the games progress as well as little hints of story.
