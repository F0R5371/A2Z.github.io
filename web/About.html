                    Hi, I'm 4lex Forseti. I am an American game developer based out of Chicago, Illinois and have always loved video games. The first time
                    I ever played a video game was at the young age of 3, when parents introduced me to mobile games. As a kid, I had always wondered how I could manipulate
                    or change the interface and mechanics of the game but never really knew how. When I was 8, things started to reveal themselves a little more as I first
                    found out about programming and looked into learning it with an app called SoloLearn. However, this was not really sufficient. When I got into middle school,
                    I had my first computer that I could use for game engines and began to experiment with things like 3D modeling and programming. I soon started to try things
                    like Roblox Studio, Unreal Engine, and then finally Unity. At first, dedication to something as big as making games seemed daunting and scary. I struggled
                    at first to stick with a game engine and kept hopping around until I really decided to take the steps to learn C# with courses from Microsoft, and one winter
                    break began to develop for a week straight. Ever since then, I have been practicing C# and have been continuing to learn through my journey with making mostly
                    2D games in Unity. Now this time, I have started a project called ASTROCREE that I really hope will be of interest to you!
                    You can find out more about ASTROCREE by going to the blog page at the top of this page and if you would like to receive future updates about my games or journeys feel
